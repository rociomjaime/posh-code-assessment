# posh-code-assessment
Hello, this is my repository for the posh code challenge assessment!

In order to launch the application please run:
`npm run dev`

This ensures that the API and UI are both running concurrently.


Application Features

1. The api must be web accessible and a user should be able to communicate with it
through the chatbot frontend (provided).
2. The api can be built in the framework of your choosing but must be done in Typescript.
3. The api must allow for sending of messages and getting a response from the bot. The
logic for the bot does not need to be sophisticated. Feel free to pick a random response
from a list of potential responses.
4. The api must allow for retrieving history (messages) for a chat.
5. The api must allow for multiple clients sending requests.
6. A database is not required - if you would like to keep track of entities in memory that is
okay, though a database may be just as easy.
